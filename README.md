# Percent Color

Takes a hex color and a percentage, spits out a new hex color. So if you want a faded version of the same color, this combines it with white to give you that.

I made this because the designer at my company kept on asking for 60% this, and 10% that, based, I assume, off of something with Photoshop. In CSS terms, these were fairly meaningless distinctions, so I decided to make a tool that would turn those things into actual colors I could use. Enjoy!
